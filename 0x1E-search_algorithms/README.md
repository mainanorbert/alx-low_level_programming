# Search Algorithm
A search algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or method for finding a particular item or piece of information from a collection of data. The collection of data could be anything from a list of numbers to a database of records or even a collection of web pages on the internet.
##  Types of Search Algorithms
1. `Linear Search (Sequential Search):` This method checks each element in the collection one by one until the desired item is found or the entire collection has been searched.

2. `Binary Search:` This algorithm is applicable only to sorted collections. It repeatedly divides the search space in half by comparing the middle element with the target value.

3. `Hashing:` Hashing involves using a hash function to map data to an index or key, making it faster to retrieve the desired item.

4. `Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS):` These algorithms are commonly used in graph traversal. DFS explores as far as possible along one branch before backtracking, while BFS explores neighboring nodes before moving on to the next level.
5. `A Search Algorithm:`* A* is a popular pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm that uses a combination of cost and heuristic function to find the most efficient path between two points.
